                       Proxying Bound UDP in HTTP
              draft-ietf-masque-connect-udp-listen-latest

Abstract

   The mechanism to proxy UDP in HTTP only allows each UDP Proxying
   request to transmit to a specific host and port.  This is well suited
   for UDP client-server protocols such as HTTP/3, but is not sufficient
   for some UDP peer-to-peer protocols like WebRTC.  This document
   proposes an extension to UDP Proxying in HTTP that enables such use-
   cases.

1.  Introduction

   The mechanism to proxy UDP in HTTP [CONNECT-UDP] allows creating
   tunnels for communicating UDP payloads [UDP] to a fixed host and
   port.  Combined with the HTTP CONNECT method (see Section 9.3.6 of
   [HTTP]), it allows proxying the majority of a Web Browser's HTTP
   traffic.  However WebRTC [WebRTC] relies on ICE [ICE] to provide
   connectivity between two Web browsers, and ICE relies on the ability
   to send and receive UDP packets to multiple hosts.  While in theory
   it might be possible to accomplish this using multiple UDP Proxying
   HTTP requests, HTTP semantics [HTTP] do not guarantee that distinct
   requests will be handled by the same server.  This can lead to the
   UDP packets being sent from distinct IP addresses, thereby preventing
   ICE from operating correctly.  Consequently, UDP Proxying requests
   cannot enable WebRTC connectivity between peers.

   This document describes an extension to UDP Proxying in HTTP that
   allows sending and receiving UDP payloads to multiple hosts within
   the scope of a single UDP Proxying HTTP request.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses terminology from [CONNECT-UDP] and notational
   conventions from [QUIC].  This document uses the terms Integer and
   List from Section 3 of [STRUCTURED-FIELDS] to specify syntax and
   parsing.  This document uses Augmented Backus-Naur Form and parsing/
   serialization behaviors from [ABNF]

2.  Proxied UDP Binding Mechanism

   In unextended UDP Proxying requests, the target host is encoded in
   the HTTP request path or query.  For Bound UDP Proxying, it is
   instead conveyed in each HTTP Datagram, see Section 3.

   When performing URI Template Expansion of the UDP Proxying template
   (see Section 3 of [CONNECT-UDP]), the client sets both the
   target_host and the target_port variables to the '*' character (ASCII
   character 0x2A).

   Before sending its UDP Proxying request to the proxy, the client
   allocates an even-numbered context ID, see Section 4 of
   [CONNECT-UDP].  The client then adds the "Connect-UDP-Bind" header
   field to its UDP Proxying request, with its value set as the
   allocated context ID, see Section 4.  If the proxy accepts the
   CONNECT UDP Bind request, it adds the allocated public IP and target
   for the client to the response, see Section 5.

3.  HTTP Datagram Payload Format

   When HTTP Datagrams [HTTP-DGRAM] associated with this Bound UDP
   Proxying request contain the context ID in the Connect-UDP-Bind
   header field, the format of their UDP Proxying Payload field (see
   Section 5 of [CONNECT-UDP]) is defined by Figure 1:

   Bound UDP Proxying Payload {
     IP Version (8),
     IP Address (32..128),
     UDP Port (16),
     UDP Payload (..),
   }

             Figure 1: Bound UDP Proxying HTTP Datagram Format

   IP Version:  The IP Version of the following IP Address field.  MUST
      be 4 or 6.

   IP Address:  The IP Address of this proxied UDP packet.  When sent
      from client to proxy, this is the target host to which the proxy
      will send this UDP payload.  When sent from proxy to client, this
      represents the source IP address of the UDP packet received by the
      proxy.  This field has a length of 32 bits when the corresponding
      IP Version field value is 4, and 128 when the IP Version is 6.

   UDP Port:  The UDP Port of this proxied UDP packet in network byte
      order.  When sent from client to proxy, this is the target port to
      which the proxy will send this UDP payload.  When sent from proxy
      to client, this represents the source UDP port of the UDP packet
      received by the proxy.

   UDP Payload:  The unmodified UDP Payload of this proxied UDP packet
      (referred to as "data octets" in [UDP]).

4.  The Connect-UDP-Bind Header Field

   The "Connect-UDP-Bind" header field’s value is an Integer.  It is set
   as the Context ID allocated for Bound UDP Proxying; see Section 2.
   Any other value type MUST be handled as if the field were not present
   by the recipients (for example, if this field is defined multiple
   times, its type becomes a List and therefore is to be ignored).  This
   document does not define any parameters for the Connect-UDP-Bind
   header field value, but future documents might define parameters.
   Receivers MUST ignore unknown parameters.

5.  The Proxy-Public-Address Response Header Field

   Upon accepting the request, the proxy MUST select at least one public
   IP address to bind.  The proxy MAY assign more addresses.  For each
   selected address, it MUST select an open port to bind to this
   request.  From then and until the tunnel is closed, the proxy SHALL
   send packets received on these IP-port tuples to the client.  The
   proxy MUST communicate the selected addresses and ports to the client
   using the "Proxy-Public-Address" header.  The header is defined as a
   List of IP-Port-tuples.  The format of the tuple is defined using IP-
   literal, IPv4address, IPv6address and port from Section 3.2 of [URI].

   ip-port-tuple = ( IP-literal / IPv4address ) ":" port

                       Figure 2: Proxy Address Format

   When a single IP-Port tuple is provided in the Proxy-Public-Address
   field, the proxy MUST use the same public IP and Port for the
   remainder of the connection.  When multiple tuples are provided,
   maintaining address stability per address family is RECOMMENDED.

   Note that since the addresses are conveyed in HTTP response headers,
   a subsequent change of addresses on the proxy cannot be conveyed to
   the client.

6.  Proxy behavior

   After accepting the Connect-UDP Binding proxying request, the proxy
   uses a UDP port to transmit UDP payloads received from the client to
   the target IP Address and UDP Port specified in each binding Datagram
   Payload received from the client.  The proxy uses the same port to
   listen for UDP packets from any authorized target and encapsulates
   the packets in the Binding Datagram Payload format, specifying the IP
   and port of the target and forwards it to the client.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described in Section 7 of [CONNECT-UDP]
   also apply here.  Since TURN can be run over this mechanism,
   implementors should review the security considerations in Section 21
   of [TURN].

   Since unextended UDP Proxying requests carry the target as part of
   the request, the proxy can protect unauthorized targets by rejecting
   requests before creating the tunnel, and communicate the rejection
   reason in response header fields.  Bound UDP Proxying requests do not
   have this ability.  Therefore, proxies MUST validate the target on
   every datagram and MUST NOT forward individual datagrams with
   unauthorized targets.  Proxies can either silently discard such
   datagrams or abort the corresponding request stream.

   Unlike non-binding CONNECT-UDP, since the proxy tunnels datagrams
   from any target to clients bound to their respective public IP and
   ports, the clients MUST be ready to handle potential unwanted traffic
   from unknown destinations.

Appendix A.  Example

   In the example below, the client is configured with URI Template
   "https://example.org/.well-known/masque/
   udp/{target_host}/{target_port}/" and wishes to use WebRTC with
   another browser over a Bound UDP Proxying tunnel.  It contacts a STUN
   server at 192.0.2.42.  The STUN server, in response, sends the
   proxy's IP address to the other browser at 203.0.113.33.  Using this
   information, the other browser sends a UDP packet to the proxy, which
   is proxied over HTTP back to the client.

Appendix B.  Comparison with CONNECT-IP

   While the use-cases described in Section 1 could be supported using
   IP Proxying in HTTP [CONNECT-IP], it would require that every HTTP
   Datagram carries a complete IP header.  This would lead to both
   inefficiencies in the wire encoding and reduction in available
   Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU).  Furthermore, Web browsers would
   need to support IPv4 and IPv6 header generation, parsing, validation
   and error handling.
