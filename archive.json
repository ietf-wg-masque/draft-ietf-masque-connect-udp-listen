(I can think of ways to do that but I won't waste your time here).\r\n\r\nAssuming you want to keep the document scope and design as is, I might suggest a tweak to the document title that more closely matches that definition. Maybe something like \"UDP socket multiplexing over single HTTP requests\" :bike::shed\"\r\n\r\n",

But, for example, where CONNECT-UDP says something like \r\n\r\n> [some IP ranges are special, clients might try them and] UDP proxies can use the\r\n   destination_ip_prohibited Proxy Error Type from Section 2.3.5 of\r\n   [[PROXY-STATUS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-masque-connect-udp-15#ref-PROXY-STATUS)] when rejecting such requests.\r\n\r\nthere's not a direct equivalent in this document because the request for `*` can't be be enforced in the same way. Instead, what might happen is a client or proxy could include a bad IP address like 127.0.0.1 by including it in the datagram payload. The recipient of this datagram would probably want to quietly drop that datagram, or maybe go so far as resetting the stream, or perhaps something in between (drop and signal?).",
